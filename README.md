# Server Setup 

You can use docker or just run the node server on your local computer. 

This does require nodejs on your machine. https://nodejs.org/en

## Install modules 
Run the following command to install your node modules.  
```
npm install
```

## Docker 
Make sure that docker desktop is installed on your computer and running. 

```
npm run docker
```

The server is now running on port 3000.  It is also in the docker containers area now. You can start and stop your server in docker from now on. 

## Without Docker 
This will run it locally on your computer. 

```
npm run start-production
```

The server is new running on port 3000 of your computer.
